  I have had a passion for programming ever since I was a child.  Starting out with BASIC, and moving on to C, C++, C# and many others, I enjoy learning new languages and ways of solving problems.
  
  Currently, I am employed at #Wizards of the Coast# in Renton, WA.  I have worked there for the last 6 years building and maintaining websites such as (https://magic.wizards.com)[Magic the Gathering], (https://gatherer.wizards.com)[Gatherer], and (https://dnd.wizards.com)[D&D].
  
  Key languages and technologies: C#, Javascript, PHP, Visual Studio, Drupal.
