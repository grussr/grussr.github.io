  I have had a passion for programming ever since I was a child.  Starting out with BASIC, and moving on to C, C++, C# and many others, I enjoy learning new languages and ways of solving problems.
  
  Currently, I am employed at *Microsoft* in Redmond, Washington.  
  
  Key languages and technologies: C#, Javascript, PHP, Visual Studio, Drupal, Docker.
